# Introduction
In the wake of one of the most significant global health crises in recent history, understanding the nuances of COVID-19's impact has become paramount. Through careful analysis and data visualization, it is important to delve into the profound shifts in COVID-19-related deaths over the years in the United States. The exploration encompasses three crucial dimensions: the overall trajectory of COVID-19 fatalities, the underlying health conditions exacerbating mortality rates, and the differential risks posed by age and health status. The overall goal of the tableau story is to serve as a sad reminder of the profound societal impact brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. By dissecting the data and visualizing key insights, the aim is to inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the general public alike to promote a collective understanding of the challenges ahead and the imperative for concerted action in the face of adversity.

# Data/ Operation Abstraction Design
The data utilized for this analysis can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/conditions-contributing-to-deaths-involving-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-by-age-group). After retrieving the data from Data.gov, it was meticulously cleaned using the Tableau interpreter which involved removing null rows to ensure data integrity. Additionally, certain adjustments were made to enhance consistency, such as refactoring state names. For instance, if a state was listed as "New York City," it was refactored to simply "New York" for uniformity in analysis and visualization.


# Future Work
For future work, it would be valuable to expand the analysis to include a longitudinal perspective, tracking the evolution of COVID-19-related deaths over time and assessing the effectiveness of various interventions and policies in mitigating the impact of the virus such as lockdown. Additionally, exploring demographic disparities beyond age, such as socioeconomic factors and access to healthcare, could provide deeper insights into the underlying drivers of COVID-19 mortality rates. Furthermore, conducting comparative analyses across different countries or regions could offer valuable insights and best practices for managing future pandemics. Not only that but integrating real-time data feeds and advanced predictive modeling techniques could also enhance the ability to anticipate and respond to emerging trends and challenges in the ongoing battle against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. In future iterations of the Tableau story, I plan to implement the suggested enhancements to improve the depth and breadth of the analysis.
